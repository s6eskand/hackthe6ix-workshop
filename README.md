# Building a REST API with Django

## Hack the 6ix Workshop by Sam Eskandar (me)

### Live Demo
If you would like to see the final product in action (authentication and all) navigate to https://music-rating.netlify.app. You can either create a new account and start with a blank slate, or play around with the test account which has some already populated data.

Rules for test account: 
  * Don't delete the JoJo song please
  * Don't post anything that will make me sad or is offensive
  * Credentials: 
    * username: _demoaccount_
    * password: _hackthe6ix_
    
Have fun! Don't break the site, I didn't spend too long on the front end.

### Running on your local machine
If you would like to play around with the code on your local machine, make sure you have the proper dependencies set up.
